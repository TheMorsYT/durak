# 🃏 Durak Card Game

## 📄 About

This project is a digital adaptation of the popular card game **"Durak"** (Fool).

The main goal of this project is to implement standard card game logic, create a highly functional user interface, and develop a competitive artificial intelligence using the **Unity Engine**.

## ✨ Current Features

* **Game Modes:** Full implementation of both "Throw-in" (Podkidnoy) and **"Transferable" (Perevodnoy)** rules.
* **Deck Options:** Support for standard 36-card decks and fast-paced **24-card decks**.
* **Advanced AI Opponent:** Play against a computer opponent with 3 difficulty levels. The AI now correctly handles transfers and manages trump cards wisely.
* **Manual Card Organization:** Drag and drop cards within your hand to sort them manually during the game.
* **Settings Management:** In-game volume control and seamless UI localization (English & Ukrainian).
* **Improved UI:** Pixel-perfect card hitboxes and responsive layout groups.

## 🎮 Planned Features

* **Automatic Sorting Settings:** Options to instantly sort the hand by **Rank** (from 6 to Ace) or by **Suit** (e.g., grouping all Hearts together).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Engine:** Unity 6 (6000.3.10f1) *(Note: Versions prior to v5.0-alpha used Unity 2019.2.8f1)*
